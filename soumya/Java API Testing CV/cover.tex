\section*{}
I am Soumya Prasad. Please allow me to introduce myself.  
I am an engineer from India with consistently good academic record. 
I have recently moved to Stockholm, but previously, 
I have worked for several years in Schneider Electric, Honeywell and GE.

In my previous roles, I was working in testing industrial automation
software. I was doing acceptance and exploratory tests. I have written
scripts for automated testing with TestComplete and Selenium. I have
worked in agile projects and diverse teams. Also closely 
interacting with development teams during the entire process. The 
teams have sometimes been international, both big and small.

I am currently looking for roles involving product management. 
I am passionate about building the right products and I believe
I can leverage my previous experiences.

I find Klarna interesting because it seem like a fun place to work
(from what I see on Instagram).  I also know I will be working with
highly skilled workers, from KonferenSE videos.
I can even think of a tagline for Klarna - lovable payments!

I am new to Stockholm and Swedish but I am quickly learning the language!
