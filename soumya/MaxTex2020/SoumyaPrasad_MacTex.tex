\section{Summary}
I am an engineer, with several years of experience within various areas of product testing. I enjoy automating tests, and in the process,
refine the product and its value, always, with the end user in focus. Continuously collaborating with developers, product owners,
account managers and testers - to best align with the use-case, while at the same time maintaining a high code coverage , are my strengths.

\hfill \break
I have been working as a QA Engineer at {\href{https://www.cabonline.com/}{\color{cyan}Cabonline Technologies AB}} since May 2019. I work
in the web team, hopping between various ReactJs applications. In my day job, I write end to end tests with {\href{https://www.cypress.io/}{\color{cyan}Cypress}}, 
dockerize the test environment and integrate into existing CI Pipelines. I also work with {\color{cyan}Storybook} \& visual component tests using Loki {\color{cyan}Loki}

\hfill \break
Business point of view, I am familiar with post trade solutions and
trading platforms in general(With hands-on knowledge of clearing technology for stock exchanges). I have also briefly worked
with IoT sensor networks and for several years in industrial automation.

\hfill \break
I am looking for testing roles involving API/Frontend/Backend testing of web-services/products. I am easy to work with,
a keen learner, very communicative and thrive working in a team. Recently, I completed a course in Computational Thinking from University Of Pennsylvania.
I can communicate in English and Swedish.
