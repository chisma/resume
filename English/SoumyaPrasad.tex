\cvsection{Summary}
\begin{cvparagraph}

  I am an engineer, with several years of experience within various areas of product testing. I enjoy automating tests, and in the process,
refine the product and its value, always, with the end user in focus. Continuously collaborating with developers, product owners,
account managers and testers - to best align with the use-case, while at the same time maintaining a high code coverage, are my strengths.

\hfill \break
I am working as a {\color{cyan}\textbf{Senior Test Consultant}} at {\href{https://b3.se/innovation/}{\color{cyan}\textbf{B3 Innovation AB}} since January 2021, currently
on a break, finishing a Linux Foundation Kubernates certification course.

\hfill \break
In my most recent assignment as Senior QA consultant, I worked with setting up the test automation frameworks for the SJ iOS app as well as SJ's internal and public facing booking
and post sales web apps. The project adheres to SAFe for aligning business and product deliveries, in which context- I contribute
actively to test strategy, prioritization and evangelizing test assets reusability and optimization   

\hfill \break
Prior to this I worked as a Senior QA Test Automation Engineer at Nasdaq, Stockholm working with a TestNg -based test framework for a complex application in a challenging build environment. Prior to that, I contributed in a \highLight{TestOps role} in an internal React Native project, working with Android/iOS testing with Appium, Selenium WebdriverIO, ReactJs application testing with 
Cypress and Google Firebase integrations, X-Ray-JIRA integration and bitbucket pipelines. I have worked with setting up a Cypress test suite, applied Postman to make manual regression testing faster and repeatable. I am a \highLight{certified SAFe 5.0 Agilist}.
I am familiar with post trade solutions and trading platforms in general(With hands-on knowledge of clearing technology for stock exchanges). Ealier in my career, I have worked for several years in industrial automation.

\hfill \break
In my upcoming assignments as a senior QA, I look forward to applying my broad experience in various aspects of Quality Assurance, coaching, test planning
and driving \enquote{shift-left} testability in exciting projects. I am ISTQB certified.
