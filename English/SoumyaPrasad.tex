\cvsection{Summary}
\begin{cvparagraph}

  I am an engineer, with several years of experience within various areas of product testing. I enjoy automating tests, and in the process,
refine the product and its value, always, with the end user in focus. Continuously collaborating with developers, product owners,
account managers and testers - to best align with the use-case, while at the same time maintaining a high code coverage, are my strengths.

\hfill \break
I am working as a {\color{cyan}\textbf{Senior Test Consultant}} at {\href{https://b3.se/innovation/}{\color{cyan}\textbf{B3 Innovation AB}} since January 2021,
I am currently contributing in a TestOps role in an internal React Native project, working with Android/iOS testing with Appium, Selenium WebdriverIO, ReactJs application testing with 
Cypress and Google Firebase integrations, X-Ray-JIRA integration and bitbucket pipelines. I was recently certified as SAFe 5.0 Agilist and working on my ISTQB certification.

\hfill \break
I am familiar with post trade solutions and
trading platforms in general(With hands-on knowledge of clearing technology for stock exchanges). I have also briefly worked
with IoT sensor networks and for several years in industrial automation.

\hfill \break
In my upcoming assignments as a senior consultant I look forward to applying my broad experience in various aspects of Quality Assurance, coaching, test planning
and driving testability in exciting projects. I thrive working in cross-functional teams.
